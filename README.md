The "Countries Guide App" is a JavaScript-based web application that provides users with information about various countries around the world. With this app, users can search for a specific country and access details such as its capital, flag, continent, currency, and primary language.

The app's user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily search for and explore different countries. It provides an interactive and engaging way to learn about different cultures, geographical locations, and important facts about various nations.

Overall, the "Countries Guide App" offers a convenient and accessible platform for users to explore and gather information about countries worldwide, enhancing their knowledge and understanding of the global community. [Live Demo](https://pranav-nani.github.io/Country_Guide_Application/).
